      <description>&lt;p&gt;(The below was contributed by the author of the software.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Feb 2019, I did my first 10 days Samskrit Sambhashan Shibir. I came to know about this&#xA;course through whats app. I loved doing the course. But I realized that it took more than 11&#xA;years to reach that message to me. Samskrit Bharti Courses have lots of potential but it was not&#xA;reaching to many people in the country and outside. Many people like me are not even aware&#xA;that something like this exists. So I am determined to fix this issue using the power of&#xA;technology and social media.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
