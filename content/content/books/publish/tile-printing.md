## kiln-fired 
In kiln-fired ceramic tile printing ( CPP or ceramic pigment printing), the ceramic pigments are fused into the tile surface at very high temperatures (around 1400°C). This process vitrifies the pigments, making the image an integral part of the tile body, highly resistant to scratching, fading, chemicals, and weathering


## Printers

- digital inkjet - ~300–360 DPI native.
  - Non-contact - Good for tiles with textures too.
  - After printing, tiles go through glazing and high-temperature firing (1200–1400°C) to permanently fuse the ink.
  - commonly 300–360 DPI native, effective resolutions can exceed 1000 DPI with multi-pass or greyscale
- laser or electrophotographic printers.
  - Resolution tends to be lower and image quality less smooth compared to inkjet.
  - Fired at lower temperatures (~1100°C) to integrate pigment into glaze.
  - Parshwa home decor Jakkur - 650 INR/sqft (2025). Low res. Other providers - min order 200.
