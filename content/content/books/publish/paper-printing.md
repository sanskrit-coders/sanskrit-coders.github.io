## Procedures
Print 200 pg A5 book - 

- Open the print window and select print to pdf instead of printer and select booklet mode.  
- That will make it a booklet of A4 size with 2 A5 pages in each A4 page. Print it.  
- Fold or cut it in the middle.  
- Bind it. Paste the cover.
  - Can make A4 covers and cut the excess book - Since, A4 photo papers are readily available.  
    So, book becomes little smaller than A5.
- Distribute it.

So, for thick books, split the pdf and make multiple booklets then merge it.
