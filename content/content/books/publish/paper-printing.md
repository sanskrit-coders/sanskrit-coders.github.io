## Procedures
### Printing
#### Terminology
Booklets - a bunch of pages to be folded at the center to make a book.

Signatures - Bunch of folded sheets that become their own section. If you expose the spine of a bound book, you will see multiple signatures. It is created as a multiple of 4. You will also notice a section/signature marking in the first page of each signature. Normally bottom left/right in some printed books.


#### Print in larger sheets
Advantage in printing with larger sheets

- can fold and staple if number of pages is small; or can do the same with "signatures".
- Consumption of warranty of no. of pages printed is halved
- Feeding the input tray is halved
- Taking out pages from output tray is halved
- To learn this in a hard way. Print 100 copies of a 100 page book. You will get to know how frequently you have to do manual repetitive work with A4. Fed every half an hour and take out every 5-10 mins.

There is no speed advantage - A3 takes twice as long as A4 to print.

Effort cost is not much 

- Just need to do a single cut and you get 2x A4


#### Overview
Print 200 pg A5 book with A4 papers - 

- Open the print window and select print to pdf instead of printer and select booklet mode.  
- That will make it a booklet of A4 size with 2 A5 pages in each A4 page. Print it.  
- Fold or cut it in the middle.  

Print A5 book with A3 papers 

- Make booklet pdf with A4 paper.
- Duplicate each A4 sheet in the A3 sheet - so you get 2 copies at once.

#### Booklet file making

Stacking copies in a sheet -

- [PdfBooklet](https://github.com/TomasResquin/PdfBooklet)
- Set Don't compress & Safe mode (slow) in Options -> Output tab
- Select x copies, rows 2, columns 1 in Layout tab


### Binding
- can use a multi hole punch (eg spiral binding) plus good twine to bind books. Simple, fast, long lasting and replaceable.
- Bind it. Paste the cover.
  - Can make A4 covers and cut the excess book - Since, A4 photo papers are readily available.  
    So, book becomes little smaller than A5.

So, for thick books, split the pdf and make multiple booklets then merge it.

### Distribution
#### Mailing
##### India Post
###### Gyan Post
Source: [TW](https://www.indiapost.gov.in/mailproducts#gyanpost)

It had a different name before. Rs. 28/kg or something similar. Max 5 kg/book parcel.

Packaging should be such that books are slightly visible from any side for their verification. 

Also, ask them for gyan post book parcel only else they will do speed post in which case even less than 1 kg will cost ₹ 150.

> But they have made it difficult it seems. I bought something recently and paid Rs. 195 for shipping. It is definitely not 6 kgs of books

- In case of Al - You can recast these sheets a few times for new pages, after which they're discarded.

Creasing machine can be A4 as well. We first cut then crease. Big printing presses first crease and then cut because they print on A0, A1, A2 etc. sizes.
