## India Post
### Gyan Post
Source: [TW](https://www.indiapost.gov.in/mailproducts#gyanpost)

It had a different name before.  
2026 Rs. 20/kg. Max 5 kg/book parcel.

#### Packaging 
##### Securing
Packaging should be such that it can't be tampered with in transit. (Not really required, but package is oft not accepted otherwise.)

Simply typing books pack with thread suffices as per sahakAra-nagar post office clerk.

##### Visibility
Packaging should be such that books are slightly visible from any side for their verification.  
Completely transparent packaging is OK; but ignorant clerks may insist that _only_ sides should be visible. Clear that up by showing precedents.

#### Billing
Ask them for gyan post book parcel only else they will do speed post in which case even less than 1 kg will cost ₹ 150.
