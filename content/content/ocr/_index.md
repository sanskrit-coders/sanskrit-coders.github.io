## Goals

- OCR important Sanskrit texts whose digitized versions are not available.
- Proofread OCR-ed texts to fix errors.

### Why digitize?

- Want to easily search for the source of that amazing shloka someone mentioned?
- Want to look up a certain term in (say) the abhyankar grammar dictionary on your phone?
- Want to read flowing text comfortably on your tablet on phone? Want your annotations to be safe for ever? (See advantages described [here](../books.md))
- Want to carry an entire library on your tablet?
- Want your phone to read out a certain text?
- Dream of a richer sanskrit wikipedia, wikisource etc..?
