title: Project ideas
---

## Intro
- People periodically enquire: "Request someone to guide me on: What I have to learn and what I can contribute." 
- Most such people end up contributing nothing despite getting fair project ideas. But some do!
- We hope some of those will contribute and share **good open source code** (perfection not required, WIP is fine).
- This page seeks to address such enquiries more concisely.

## Contribute to existing open source projects
### First find a project / team which fits you.

- Click around this site, find useful tools and ideas. Then find out where the source code is published.
  - Contribute to this site while at it: "Please fix by clicking on the pencil icon and sending a pull request as and when you find errors."
- Visit some github organizations and users directly, look at their repositories.
  - An incomplete list, feel free to submit more: 
    - [sanskrit-coders](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders), [sanskrit](https://github.com/sanskrit), [indic-dict](https://github.com/indic-dict), [dhaval](https://github.com/drdhaval2785/), [ashtadhyayi](https://github.com/ashtadhyayi)

- Look at [mailing list announcements](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sanskrit-programmers).

### Then contribute

- Read some of the source code, contact authors for ideas about how to contribute. Send pull requests, open github issues, sent emails on our mailing list.
